# Logistics and Supply Chain Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes logistics and supply chain data using Python. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and various visualizations to gain insights into sales, revenue, and transportation methods.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about supply chain logistics, including
- Product Type Category of products.
- Price Price of the products.
- Revenue Generated Revenue from product sales.
- Number of Products Sold Total quantity sold.
- Transportation Carrier Mode of transportation used.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (Data visualization)
- Plotly (Interactive charts)
- NumPy (Numerical computations)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values
- Checked for null values and performed necessary data preprocessing

### 2. Data Visualization
- Scatter Plot Analyzed the relationship between product price and revenue.
- Pie Chart Visualized product sales by category.
- Bar Charts Analyzed top-selling products and transportation modes.

## Insights Gained
- Identified the most profitable product categories.
- Analyzed the effectiveness of different transportation carriers.
- Found trends in sales and revenue generation.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
                        git clone repository_url

3. Install dependencies:
                        pip install pandas numpy seaborn plotly matplotlib
   
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or execute the script:
                        jupyter notebook LogisticsAnalysis.ipynb

## Future Improvements
- Implement predictive modeling for demand forecasting.
- Optimize transportation logistics using machine learning.
- Automate real-time analytics dashboards.
